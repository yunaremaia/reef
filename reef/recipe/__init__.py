"""The recipe contract and its machinery — what a method implements.

A recipe is *how records and their feedback become a new version of the
weights or the harness*. This package holds everything a method binds to:

- ``base`` — ``Recipe`` (the default record-only recipe and base contract:
  ``build``, ``build_artifact_validator``, ``build_surface``, the
  ``CheckpointStrategy``) and ``WeightTrainingRecipe`` with its
  ``WeightTrainingSpec`` (step preparer, loss family, data processor).
- ``registry`` — dotted class resolution (``recipe_class_for``) and
  ``build_named_recipe`` for a deployment preset.
- ``config_fields`` — one dataclass field as the whole configuration surface
  for one setting (YAML key, env fallback, typed parser).
- ``config`` — recipe-config YAML loading; ``errors`` — the error family.

Candidate evaluation is part of this contract, not a separate subsystem:
every ``Recipe`` carries ``candidate_evaluation``, built from the top-level
``evaluation`` section of its config, and the trainer runs it between
prepare and settle. Its types (``CandidateEvaluator``, ``CandidateSelector``,
``CandidateEvaluationPlugin``, ``AlwaysSelectMixin``) live in
``reef.train.evaluation`` because the trainer, backends, and runtime bind to
them too — the recipe is what chooses and configures them.

Learning methods live outside the core package. The repository's sibling
``recipes`` tree contains cookbook implementations, but Reef neither imports
them at boot nor ships them in its wheel. Deployments select one explicitly by
its dotted ``package.module:ClassName`` reference.

The recipe decides; it does not execute or deliver. ``build`` returns a
``Trainer``, ``build_artifact_validator`` an admission policy,
``build_surface`` serving capabilities, and the scenario binds them with the
runtime as peers. The dependency points down only — this package imports
``scenario``, ``train``, ``surface``, and ``runtime``, never the reverse,
and never ``reef.train.slime_backend`` at module scope.
