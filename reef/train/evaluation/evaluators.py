"""Built-in candidate-evaluation mixins and the default plugin.

A :class:`~reef.train.evaluation.contracts.CandidateEvaluationPlugin` is a single
class that both measures a candidate (``evaluate``) and decides whether to
publish it (``decide``). Rather than composing an evaluator object with a
selector object, a plugin mixes in the methods it needs: a *decide* mixin
(:class:`AlwaysSelectMixin`, :class:`RegressionGateMixin`) and, when the
measurement comes from the training backend rather than the plugin's own code,
the :class:`BackendEvaluateMixin`.

Every mixin inherits the plugin contract and implements one half of it, so the
other half stays abstract: a mixin cannot be instantiated on its own, and a
plugin is only concrete once both halves are supplied.

    class MyPlugin(RegressionGateMixin):
        def __init__(self, ...):
            super().__init__(metric="clean_rate", margin=0.17)
            ...
        def evaluate(self, candidate): ...   # its own measurement

    class BackendScored(ScoreMixin, BackendEvaluateMixin):
        def __init__(self, backend, **kw):
            super().__init__(**kw)           # the decide mixin's config
            self._backend = backend          # BackendEvaluateMixin reads this
