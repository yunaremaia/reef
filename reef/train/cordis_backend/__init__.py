"""Harness evolution backend: candidate selection scored by real episodes.

Per training step, ``propose`` reads the current composition and the batched
traces and returns one ``Mutation`` or a sequence of them; the backend
applies the proposal to the compose Entry tree under one snapshot; the
candidate and current compositions render through the adapter descriptor and
each run one headless episode per task; the method's ``EpisodeScorer`` scores
individual results. The recipe picks the ``CandidateEvaluationPlugin`` class
that pairs this measurement with a selection policy and hands it to ``Trainer``.
A sequence is one
composite proposal: it applies
atomically and receives one selection decision, never one per mutation. The
default policy selects a candidate with more task wins than losses.

Versioning goes through reef's native artifact stack: a selected mutation
renders to a directory and returns a ``TrainStepResult`` with the artifact
set, so ``ScenarioCommitProtocol`` stages and publishes it through
``Repository``. The composition tree state travels in the algorithm state
(``"entries"`` key), which the commit log and snapshot metadata persist and
recover.
