"""Server-side rendering of the one-command harness install script.

``GET /reef/harness/install`` answers with a self-contained POSIX sh
script: the composition files ride inline as quoted heredocs, so running
the script makes no reef callback and carries no token. The binary's bytes
never come from reef: the script checks the locally installed binary
against the descriptor's pinned version and, only on absence or mismatch,
runs the vendor's own install command. Before writing, the script removes
the files a previous install's release file recorded that the new composition
lacks, exactly like the stdlib client pull, so installing an older version
never leaves a newer version's files behind. After writing, the script
verifies a sha256 over the sorted relative paths, byte lengths, and file
bytes against the value baked in at render time, and records the pulled
version in the same release file the stdlib client pull writes, plus what the
release requires of the person (``requires``) and the check offs
``reef-<adapter> setup`` recorded (``setup``, carried over from the previous
release file). A release with an item the release file on disk does not check off is
refused first of all, before the binary is installed or a directory is
made, with the setup list and the release that installs on a machine with
nothing set up as the message; the refusal needs python3 only. Rerunning when everything already matches
writes nothing at all, not even the release file, and says "already current".
The interpreter is decided once: the python3 the installing shell resolves,
followed through to the interpreter behind it and pinned by absolute path
into the wrapper, so a later shell with another python3 on PATH runs the one
that passed the import check here.

    """The complete install script for one adapter and one served manifest.

    The manifest side (``files``, ``release_id``) is adapter-agnostic;
    the descriptor contributes the binary's vendor install path. ``scenario``
    is baked into the wrapper so ``reef-<adapter> report`` knows which
    scenario to report to. ``binding_files`` are the adapter's config targets
    re-rendered with the model binding that points the harness at Reef; they
    carry ``TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER`` where the token goes, and the script writes
    them over the pulled files after the checksum, filling the placeholder
    from ``$REEF_TOKEN``. ``requires`` is the manifest's list of what the
    release needs from the person over its chain: the script refuses,
    before it installs or writes anything, while one item is not checked
    off in the release file on disk, naming ``fallback_release_id`` (the newest
    release in the chain that requires nothing) as the one to install on a
    machine with nothing set up, and records the list in the release file it
    writes. Raises ``DescriptorError`` when the descriptor declares no
    install section and ``ValueError`` when a composition path is absolute
    or escapes the destination through a ``..`` part, the same rule the
    stdlib client pull applies to served paths, or when an item of
    ``requires`` is not of the shape the training route admits (the union
    of a chain may exceed one request's cap).
