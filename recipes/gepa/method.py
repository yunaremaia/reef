"""The two seams GEPA plugs into: the proposer and the selection policy.

One GEPA iteration is split across the mechanism's step. ``GEPAProposer``
owns the half GEPA calls the reflective mutation: sample a parent from the
archive's Pareto front, evaluate it on a minibatch, reflect on one component
with the feedback that minibatch produced, evaluate the child on the same
minibatch, and accept only a strict improvement. ``GEPASelectorMixin`` owns the
other half, the full validation pass: the mechanism has already run every
``evolution.tasks`` prompt on both compositions by the time ``decide`` is
called, so the per-task scores in its evaluation are exactly GEPA's valset
evaluation, and recording them is what updates the fronts and moves the
served composition.

The parent's minibatch costs no episodes when the parent is the served
composition: the mechanism already batched that composition's real recorded
traffic, scores included. Any other parent has to be re-run, because no
traffic was ever served from it. The archive's metric-call count follows
GEPA's accounting regardless - the seed's validation, every parent and child
minibatch, every accepted candidate's validation - so a budget means what it
means upstream. The mechanism's own re-run of the served composition over the
validation set at every evaluated step is extra wall time and spend that the
count leaves out.
