Configure Reef serving and training
===================================

A deployment config is one YAML file. ``reef serve -c <file>`` reads it, starts
every process in its ``services`` list in dependency order, and hands the
``reef`` section to the HTTP service.

.. code:: yaml

   reef:
     host: 0.0.0.0
     port: 8900
     recipe: recipe
     token: ${REEF_TOKEN}
     upstream_url: ${REEF_UPSTREAM_URL}
     upstream_api_key: ${REEF_UPSTREAM_API_KEY}

   services:
     - name: reef
       command: ["${REEF_PYTHON}", "-m", "reef.service"]
       ready: curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:${reef.port}/healthz

Values interpolate from the environment with ``${VAR}`` and from the config
itself with ``${dotted.path}``. Any value can be overridden on the command line:
a bare ``--model_path /models/demo`` targets the ``reef`` section, and a dotted
``--training.checkpoint_dir /tmp/ckpt`` targets any other. Each process writes a
log under ``/tmp/reef-stack/``; set ``run_dir`` to move it.

Use ``${VAR:?}`` for a required environment variable, for example
``upstream_model: ${REEF_UPSTREAM_MODEL:?}``. If it is unset, empty, or only
whitespace, Reef reports the missing variable names and their config fields
before downloading models or starting processes. Command-line overrides are
applied before this check, so ``--upstream_model <model-id>`` can supply the
value instead. Plain ``${VAR}`` keeps resolving to an empty string when unset;
use it for optional values such as an API key for a provider without authentication.

``REEF_PYTHON`` defaults to the interpreter that launched ``reef serve`` and
can be overridden in the environment. Use it when a service must share Reef's
Python environment. A literal ``python`` keeps its normal meaning and is
resolved from that service's ``PATH``; Reef never rewrites command names.

Scenario-specific model settings are supplied through the existing scenario
create/update API. See `Scenario model configuration <../user-guide/scenario-models.rst>`__
for model selection, persistence and platform upgrades. Omitting the model
setting preserves deployment-wide configuration.

Start from a cookbook stack
---------------------------

The source checkout's runnable stacks live under the ``recipes/`` cookbook
and ``tutorials/``: the learn-nothing ones use the core ``recipe``
implementation in ``recipes/basic/``, each weight-training method owns its
examples, and harness evolution ships as a tutorial.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| File                                                        | What it starts                                           |

+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Each weight-training example ships its stack as ``serve.yaml``.
``recipes/sao/examples/sao/serve.yaml`` is the smallest, two GPUs for one
actor and one rollout engine; ``recipes/tttd/examples/tttd/serve.yaml`` adds
LoRA training, and ``recipes/openclawrl/examples/openclawrl/serve.yaml`` adds
a PRM engine and a student model.

The ``reef`` section
--------------------

.. config::

   reef.recipe | the recipe this deployment serves. Required.
   reef.host | 0.0.0.0 | bind address
   reef.port | 8900 | bind port
   reef.console_origins | [] | exact browser console origins allowed to access the HTTP service; disabled by default
   reef.token | the bearer token the service accepts. Use ``tokens: [...]`` to accept several while rotating.
   reef.model_path | a local HF model directory or a repo id, downloaded on start
   reef.upstream_url | the OpenAI-compatible provider, with no ``/v1`` suffix
   reef.upstream_api_key | its credential. Reef is the only party that sees it.
   reef.upstream_model | the model to request upstream
   reef.upstream_api | openai | the provider dialect: ``openai`` for Chat Completions, ``responses`` for OpenAI Responses, or ``anthropic`` for an Anthropic-style endpoint
   reef.inference_url | the address the training backend reports | the local engine; set only to front the engines with something else
   reef.inference_timeout_s | 300.0 | per-request timeout
   reef.allow_implicit_scenario_creation | true | when false, an unknown scenario is HTTP 404
   reef.checkpoint_every_n_versions | 1 | how often a version becomes durable

Storage paths default under ``.reef/``, which the basic and sao stacks keep;
the openclawrl stack overrides them to ``/var/lib/reef``. Point them somewhere
persistent.

.. config::

   reef.artifact_repository | .reef/artifacts.git | the Git-backed release chain
   reef.artifact_work_dir | .reef/artifact-work | materialization scratch
   reef.artifact_cache_dir | .reef/artifact-cache | fetched artifact cache
   reef.agent_record_dir | .reef/agent-record | the record store
   reef.agent_record_retention_days | 7.0 | compacted trace bodies expire this many days after compaction
   reef.agent_record_retention_max_bytes | 21474836480 | 20 GiB shared across compacted trace bodies in the record directory

.. warning::

   On ephemeral storage, a restart loses the record store, the commit logs, and
   every version.

The record store keeps trace bodies after training compaction. Compaction marks
records as retired from training; it does not remove their requests, responses,
or feedback from SQLite immediately. The HTTP service starts retention cleanup
at startup and repeats it every 60 seconds, outside the inference and training
request paths. It first removes bodies older than 7 days, then the oldest
remaining bodies until their total fits within 20 GiB. Both limits are
configurable above and must be positive; the time limit must also be finite.

The byte budget counts UTF-8 JSON payloads, references, and artifact references
across all scenario databases, including databases under ``archived/``. It is
shared across the directory, not allocated separately to each scenario. Deletes
commit in batches of 256. Active records, retry hashes, and commit/receipt
metadata are retained. Cleanup failures are logged and retried on the next sweep.

This is a retained-body budget, not a hard disk quota. Incoming compaction can
exceed the budget between sweeps; active records, indexes, hashes, commit logs,
and WAL files take additional space. SQLite reuses pages freed by cleanup but
does not automatically shrink the database file. Allow additional disk headroom.
Standalone Python stores do not start a maintenance task; see `Python API <python-api.rst>`__
for explicit retention and purge methods.

Existing stores gain ``compacted_at`` and ``body_bytes`` columns when opened.
The migration measures retained JSON byte sizes once. Already
deleted bodies cannot be recovered by this migration. Older Reef versions do
not filter that column: stop the service and restore a pre-upgrade backup for
rollback, or purge all compacted bodies with the new version before downgrading.
Do not share a migrated store between old and new writers.

Recipe settings such as ``batch_size`` sit beside these in the same section,
along with any others the recipe declares with ``config_field``. When
``reef.recipe`` is a dotted weight-training class, keys the service does not
recognize are handed to the recipe, and the recipe rejects any key it does
not declare. With the core ``recipe`` or a named preset, the recipe reads its
configuration from the preset, and unrecognized keys here are silently
ignored.

Recipe configuration
--------------------

``data.training_mode`` is shared by all recipes and defaults to ``auto``.
In ``auto``, the recipe's processor decides when its data can form a batch,
and ``POST /reef/train`` is refused. In ``manual``, inference and reports
cannot authorize training by themselves; ``POST /reef/train`` supplies the
user instruction, and harness evolution runs it alone. In ``hybrid``, the
processor batches as in ``auto`` and runs instructions too, a queued
instruction first; harness evolution hands the proposer, beside the
instruction, the units an automatic batch would take next, up to
``batch_size`` and possibly none: failing traces in the score window, or
records under ``data.batch_policy: records``. The processor defines
what an instruction batch carries, independently of its automatic batching
policy.
For a dotted weight-training deployment this field is also accepted as
``reef.training_mode``. Named presets set it in their own ``data`` section.

The processor receives ``ProcessorContext.training_mode`` as its initial
batching mode. The modes share ingestion and retention; the
``make_training_batch(batch_number, request)`` hook selects batch inputs.
Processors declare ``supported_training_modes``; unsupported modes or missing
instruction assembly raise ``NotImplementedError``.
Harness evolution supports the three modes and requires a proposer that
explicitly accepts ``requests`` for ``manual`` and ``hybrid``. Setting either
on an inference-only recipe does not create a training backend.

.. code:: yaml

   data:
     training_mode: hybrid

The mode controls training initiation, independently of
``evolution.publish: auto | review``. It supplies the initial processor mode.
Use ``POST /reef/scenarios/{scenario}/update`` to select another mode
at runtime. This changes subsequent batches; a reserved batch completes under
its original mode. Mode changes are not persisted: a service restart uses the
recipe's configured mode again, while a scenario reload after a failed step
keeps the selected mode. In ``manual`` the reported-feedback processor holds
at most four batches of units and releases the oldest beyond that with a
warning, at the switch to ``manual`` and as reports arrive.

.. config::

   data.training_mode | auto | ``manual`` waits for ``POST /reef/train`` instructions instead of batching by the recipe's rules; ``hybrid`` batches by the recipe's rules and runs a queued instruction first

A recipe is selected three ways:

- **The core record-only recipe:** ``recipe: recipe``
- **A dotted class:** ``recipe: "my_pkg.my_method:MyMethodRecipe"``
- **A named preset:** ``recipe: my-preset``, resolved to ``my-preset.yaml``
  under ``REEF_RECIPE_CONFIG_DIR``

There is no recipe-implementation registry. A bare name other than ``recipe``
is always a preset name; it never imports a learning method implicitly.

A dotted class does not have to be pip-installed. ``reef serve`` looks for
its top-level package beside the config, walking up from the config file's
directory to the nearest ancestor that holds ``<package>/__init__.py``, and
appends that directory to ``PYTHONPATH`` for every service it starts. This is
how ``recipes.sao.recipe:SAORecipe`` resolves from a source checkout: the
``recipes/`` cookbook sits next to the example's ``serve.yaml``, so the
launcher does not export ``PYTHONPATH`` itself. Entries already in
``PYTHONPATH`` keep their precedence, and a service's ``env`` map can still
set the variable outright.

``REEF_RECIPE_CONFIG_DIR`` is the directory preset YAML is read from, and it has
**no default**: a bare recipe name resolves to a preset only when it is set.
The one kind of preset reef bundles is a recipe's profile under
``reef/service/profiles/``: ``reef serve --recipe <name>`` points this
variable at that directory and reads the profile as both the deployment
config and the preset (see `the CLI reference <cli.rst>`__).

A preset is read as-is. ``${VAR}`` interpolates in a deployment config, never
in a preset. A preset carries its own ``implementation``, ``model``, and
``data`` sections, plus an optional ``runtime`` section when the recipe
builds its own runtime instead of using the deployment's upstream proxy.
When using the deployment's runtime, a preset may omit ``model.path`` to
inherit that runtime's model (``reef.upstream_model`` for an upstream proxy).
An explicit ``model.path`` takes precedence. A preset with its own ``runtime``
section must still supply its own non-empty ``model.path``.
Harness-evolution presets also carry an ``evolution`` section:

.. code:: yaml

   implementation: reef.train.cordis_backend.recipe:CordisRecipe
   model:
     path: qwen3-8b
   data:
     batch_size: 1
     max_score: 0.0
   evolution:
     adapter: pi
     propose: methods.mine:propose
     evaluate: methods.mine:evaluate
     tasks: ["..."]

The preset's ``implementation`` is ``recipe`` or a dotted recipe class. Weight-training
recipes are selected directly by dotted class in the deployment config, so the
service can assemble their Ray training runtime; their fields are flat
``reef.<name>`` keys. Presets suit recipes whose runtime can be built from the
preset or the deployment's upstream proxy. There, ``data`` holds batching
fields and a recipe-specific section holds the rest.

A preset's ``runtime.type: executor_training`` selects an executor-backed
training coordinator. Its ``executor`` mapping accepts ``backend`` (default
``auto``, resolving to ``uni``, ``mp`` or ``ray``, or a custom executor import path), ordered ``workers`` and backend
``options``. ``coordinator_rank`` defaults to zero. Existing ``ray_training``
configuration still connects to a named bridge. The Slime driver's separate
``--reef-executor-backend`` selects the model worker executor and defaults to
``auto`` (currently Slime's Ray launcher). See `Worker executors <../developer-guide/executors.rst>`__ for the full
contracts and examples.

Stack execution backends
------------------------

``execution.services`` selects the deployment executor (default ``auto``).
``services[].executor`` overrides it for one service, including SGLang, PRM,
Slime driver or Reef itself. ``execution.training`` and ``execution.rollout``
select the Slime training-worker and rollout-control executors (both default
``auto``, resolving to ``ray``). All selectors accept a backend name/import path or a profile under
``executors``. Inline objects/profiles accept ``backend`` (default ``auto``),
``options``, ``workers``, and ``resources`` containing ``cpus_per_worker`` and
``gpus_per_worker``. Counts must be positive integers; resource quantities must
be finite nonnegative numbers. Numeric environment interpolation is accepted.

``execution.evolution`` selects harness evaluation workers (default ``auto``).
Unlike Slime, ordinary harness evolution calls external model endpoints and
does not need local GPUs: one worker selects ``uni``, multiple workers select
``mp``. Local GPU worker requirements follow the same topology rule after
checking visible CUDA capacity; insufficient GPUs fail with a prompt to
explicitly select ``ray``. Multiple workers inside a Ray placement group or
declared cluster/actor options select ``ray``. Local allocations require whole
GPUs; fractional reservations require explicit Ray. The former worker-level
``local`` executor is removed (the separate episode-isolation option is unchanged).
Omitted resources retain component defaults (normally one CPU and no GPUs).
CPU-only local executors do not reserve cores or enforce CPU quotas.

Service executors accept the same resources, mapped to per-service launch
requests, but ``workers`` must be one: service replicas are not implemented.
Slime training/rollout reject these generic workers/resources fields; their
model-parallel topology and placement groups still come from Slime's existing
training configuration. Resource declarations are never silently treated as
model-parallel resizing.

For services, ``auto`` selects ``uni`` unless resource/worker options
or an existing Ray placement group call for Ray. Explicit local CUDA visibility
selects ``uni`` and cannot be combined with cluster resource options.
Explicit service selectors and Slime CLI flags override the corresponding role
defaults. Backend startup failures never silently fall back to another backend.

For Ray services, ``resources`` supplies actor launch options such as
``num_gpus`` and ``num_cpus``; do not also set ``cuda``. A service can publish
``endpoint: http://{host}:23001`` and dependents can use
``${endpoints.SERVICE_NAME}``. Readiness runs on the service's execution node,
and dependencies are topologically sorted. Local services advertise localhost
unless ``advertise_host`` is set. See the `whole-stack examples and backend
contracts <../developer-guide/executors.rst#whole-stack-deployment-configuration>`__
before moving services across nodes.

Harness evolution keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``batch_size`` and ``max_score`` go under ``data:``; the rest goes under
``evolution:``. `Evolve your harness
<../user-guide/evolve-your-harness.rst>`__ describes what each one changes.

.. config::

   data.batch_size | 1 | traces per mutation attempt
   data.max_score | 0.0 | upper bound of the score window that batches
   data.batch_policy | reports | ``records`` batches recorded traffic alone, every ``batch_size`` requests, with unscored samples

The window has no lower bound, so the default keeps only traces at or below
zero.

.. config::

   evolution.propose | a ``Proposer``, a plain callable, or a dotted ``module:attribute``
   evolution.evaluate | an ``EpisodeScorer``, likewise
   evolution.selection | score_comparison | ``always``, or a dotted reference to an object with ``decide``
   evolution.tasks | non-empty list of episode prompts, scored once per tree per step
   evolution.adapter | pi | ``opencode``, ``claude``, ``codex``, ``dsh`` (DeepSeek Harness), ``hermes`` (Hermes Agent), ``native`` (Reef's own agent, whose tools are ``native_tool`` nodes, whose loop events listen to ``native_hook`` nodes, and whose loop is a ``native_graph`` node or, as code, a ``native_loop`` node), ``terminus`` (Terminal-Bench's Terminus 2, through a Reef-owned Harbor runner), or an entry-point adapter
   evolution.binary | a path to the harness binary; unset, backend construction installs the adapter's pinned version through the vendor's channel under ``$REEF_HARNESS_PREFIX`` (default ``~/.local/share/reef-harness``)
   evolution.episode_timeout_s | 600 | seconds one evaluation episode may run
   evolution.episode_repeats | 1 | episode pairings per task per step; each repeat tallies on its own
   evolution.forbid_residue | false | when true, an episode leaving files outside the cleanup whitelist scores as one that could not run
   evolution.max_steps | 0 | stop automatic evolve steps once this many steps ran, instruction steps included; 0 disables the limit; an instruction from ``POST /reef/train`` still runs past it
   evolution.max_failure_streak | 0 | stop automatic evolve steps after this many consecutive rejected steps, instruction steps included; 0 disables the limit; an instruction from ``POST /reef/train`` still runs while the breaker is open
   evolution.max_model_calls_per_step | 0 | cap the proposer's model calls in one step; 0 disables the limit
   evolution.executor | local | ``local`` runs episodes as a plain subprocess (development, hermetic tests); ``sandbox`` runs each in a bubblewrap jail for a hosted service and refuses to start without it; it also refuses every episode of a ``self_isolating`` adapter such as ``terminus``, whose Docker task container cannot nest in the jail
   execution.evolution.workers | 1 | fixed worker-group size; CPU auto selects ``uni`` for one and ``mp`` for multiple
   execution.evolution.backend | auto | worker placement, independent of the ``local/sandbox`` episode isolation policy; ``local`` retains shared-memory callbacks
   execution.evolution.resources | | ``cpus_per_worker`` and ``gpus_per_worker``; omitted values retain component defaults; GPUs select Ray under ``auto`` and cannot reduce declared GPU needs
   evolution.episode_workers / worker_executor / worker_resources | | deprecated compatibility aliases; conflicting resource values are rejected; legacy worker_executor cannot accompany role-level workers/resources
   evolution.sandbox | | the sandbox executor's policy: ``egress_hosts`` (allowlisted model endpoints; empty denies network) and ``limits`` (``cpu_seconds``, ``memory_bytes``, ``processes``, ``file_bytes``)
   evolution.promote_failures | false | when true, a failing trace's prompt becomes a permanent gate task, so no later candidate can win while bringing the failure back; the seed tasks stay the floor
   evolution.max_promoted_tasks | 50 | the cap on promoted tasks; admission stops there so the suite is bounded
   evolution.max_promoted_per_client | 5 | the cap on promoted tasks from one tagged client (its ``x-reef-tag-client``, else session, tag); untagged traffic has no identity to count under and meets only ``max_promoted_tasks``; 0 disables the cap
   evolution.promote | | optional callable or dotted ``module:attribute`` choosing which trace prompts to promote; receives the step's samples (and the failure manifest when its signature names ``manifest``); without it every failing trace's user prompt is promoted, and the caps and the credential and directive screens still apply
   evolution.publish | auto | ``review`` holds every gate win as a pending release until ``POST /reef/scenarios/{scenario}/promote`` names it
   evolution.review_kinds | [] | node kinds whose wins wait for a promote while the rest publish at once; a win that touches a ``native_loop`` waits whether or not the list names it
   evolution.seed | entry options loaded into the tree on first boot, or a dotted ``module:attribute`` naming a sequence of them (``reef.harness.runners.native.seed:SEED_NODES`` is the native harness's shipped tools and hook); recovered state takes precedence
   evolution.models | auxiliary models for the method: ``url``, ``model``, optional ``api`` (default ``openai``) and ``timeout_s``, with the credential as a literal ``api_key`` or an ``api_key_env`` variable name
   evolution.version_check | appends the adapter's update notice; an interactive pulled tree offers to run the update or skip when behind
   evolution.requests | false | appends the adapter's harness requests extension and its extension API skill after the notice (the reserved entries ``reef-requests`` and ``reef-pi-extension-api``), so a ``reef-pi`` session gets ``/reef-harness <request>`` in the TUI (submits to ``POST /reef/train``, which needs ``data.training_mode: hybrid`` or ``manual``) and the method reads the API reference before it writes an extension; ``pi`` only, other adapters refuse boot (a seed entry: a deployment that boots from a recovered state keeps its tree, as with ``version_check``); the tutorial's ``tutorials/evolve-your-harness/configs/deployment.yaml`` sets it, with ``version_check: true`` and ``review_kinds: [code_extension]``
   evolution.proposals_dir | .reef/proposals | where agent proposals from ``POST /reef/harness/proposals`` wait for the next evolve step: one directory per scenario under it (``<dir>/<scenario>``, made absolute at build, created when the first proposal arrives), with ``claimed/``, ``refused/`` and ``settled/`` beside the pending files
   evolution.max_pending_proposals | 8 | how many admitted proposals one scenario holds; the route answers ``admitted: false`` with reason ``inbox full`` beyond it, and with reason ``manual mode takes instructions only`` on a scenario in ``data.training_mode: manual``
   evolution.step_record_dir | | off by default; when set, every step writes its record under ``<dir>/<scenario>/<step>`` (the path is made absolute at build): ``proposer.json`` (each model call the proposer made: ``model``, ``messages`` and ``params`` for a ``chat`` or ``body`` for a ``complete``, then ``reply`` and the provider ``response`` for a built-in ``chat`` binding, ``response`` for ``complete``, or ``error``, and ``seconds``; the response retains provider reasoning/thinking fields when returned; long text is clipped with a marker and a credential shaped literal is replaced by ``[redacted credential]``), ``mutations.json`` (the parsed proposal with its full options, refused or not, redacted the same way) and ``episodes/<side>-<task index>/`` (each gate episode's trajectory files as the adapter writes them, copied out of its root before the root is removed, plus ``episode.json`` with the task, the exit code, stdout and stderr, the residue, the score, the failure and the stage path; a repeat adds ``-<repeat>``); a recheck step writes ``episodes/`` only and has no proposer files; a step skipped on the step cap or the failure streak writes nothing; a step directory is never reused, so a retried step lands in ``<step>-2``, then ``<step>-3``; nothing prunes the directory; an unwritable path refuses boot and a record copy that fails aborts the step instead of scoring it

The served model's binding is appended at render time; it never enters the
published files. The seed defines the baseline the first mutation is measured
against. The step record holds the proposer's raw traffic and every gate
episode's session log, so treat its directory like the commit log.

The ``services`` list
---------------------

Each entry is one process. ``command`` can be a command-line string or an argv
list. Prefer the list form when exact argument boundaries matter; existing
string commands retain their current ``shlex`` parsing.

.. config::

   services[].name | the service's id, used by ``depends_on``; unique within one stack
   services[].command | the command line string or argv list to run
   services[].ready | a shell command that succeeds once the service is up
   services[].ready_timeout | seconds to wait for ``ready`` before giving up; the top-level ``ready_timeout`` sets the default
   services[].depends_on | services that must be ready first
   services[].cuda | optional ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` for local services; Ray services must declare ``resources.num_gpus`` instead
   services[].env | extra environment variables

The ``training`` section
------------------------

Read by the weight-training stack. See `Evolve your model
<../user-guide/evolve-your-model.rst>`__ for how to size it.

.. config::

   training.num_gpus | example-specific GPU count passed to Slime's model topology flags; does not reserve GPUs for the driver or set the Ray cluster's capacity
   training.global_batch_size | samples in one optimizer step. Must equal the recipe's ``batch_size``.
   training.checkpoint_dir | where Megatron and HF checkpoints are written
   training.megatron_checkpoint_path | optional pre-converted torch_dist checkpoint, to skip HF conversion on every start
   training.checkpoint_retention | storage-fraction bounds and the retention policy
   training.slime_flags | GPU layout, optimizer, sequence length, and loss settings, as one literal string

Slime fills architecture flags such as layer counts and hidden sizes from
``reef.model_path``. Do not put them in the config.

The ``evaluation`` section
--------------------------

Only weight-training recipes read this section; a deployment that pairs it
with any other recipe fails at startup, because a harness recipe builds its
evaluator in code. Absent by default, in which case a successful
weight-training step publishes without a gate. When present, Reef calls the
named factory once per scenario and hands the plugin the exported but
unpublished checkpoint.

.. config::

   evaluation.module | a ``package.module:factory`` reference to the plugin factory. Required.
   evaluation.config | opaque mapping handed to the factory; Reef never reads it

.. code:: yaml

   evaluation:
     module: my_pkg.evaluation:build_evaluator
     config:
       benchmark: gsm8k
       threshold: 0.8

The plugin interface is in `Write a recipe
<../developer-guide/write-a-recipe.rst#gate-a-candidate>`__.

Experiment tracking
-------------------

Tracking is optional, off by default, and belongs to a Reef *scenario* rather
than to one training backend. The same provider-neutral logger is shared by the
recipe, the processor, backend results, and the commit lifecycle. Install
``reef[wandb]`` when the training extra does not already provide it.

.. code:: yaml

   observability:
     wandb:
       enabled: true
       project: reef
       entity: your-team             # optional
       group_prefix: prod-us-east    # optional scenario-group namespace
       name_prefix: baseline         # optional run-name prefix
       tags: [openclawrl, qwen]
       mode: online                  # online, offline, or disabled
       directory: /var/lib/reef/wandb
       upload_checkpoints: false

Export ``WANDB_API_KEY`` before starting, or log in once with the credential
store on the cluster.

.. warning::

   There is no API-key field here. Reef rejects Slime's ``--wandb-key`` flag and
   never writes a credential into metrics or run config. Do not put one in the
   YAML, in ``slime_flags``, in a tag, or in a run name.

``online`` sends data to the project. ``offline`` makes no network calls and
writes syncable data below ``directory`` for a later ``wandb sync``.
``disabled`` makes no calls even when ``enabled`` is true.

Each scenario maps to a group named after the scenario or
``<group_prefix>/<scenario>``. Within it, Reef opens one run when the scenario
binds and another after each rollback. The deterministic run id includes those
identities, so restarting resumes the same run with ``resume=allow``. A rollback
finishes the current run, marks its summary with the source and target, and
resets ``train/step`` to zero; the globally monotonic ``reef/step`` stays
attached for joining a run back to the commit log.

Recipe and processor code logs through the same object without importing W&B:

.. code:: python

   experiment_logger.log({"temperature": 0.6}, namespace="recipe")
   self.experiment_logger.log({"accepted": 12}, namespace="processor")

Those become ``recipe/*`` and ``processor/*``, each namespace on its own
``<namespace>/event`` axis. Only finite numeric values are sent.

Durable commit metrics carry ``experiment/provider``, ``experiment/project``,
``experiment/group``, and ``experiment/run_id``. Use them to open the run from
a Reef version, and use the run's ``reef/training_job_id`` to go the other way.
Checkpoint paths are metadata only unless ``upload_checkpoints: true``.

Import, initialization, logging, summary, and upload failures are reported in
the service log and never fail a training step or its commit.
